# Testing out stuff

Just testing out github pages and in the meantime having clearvision v6 css in here to easily use the skin on all of my devices. 
(Copying the file each time when discord updates their stylesheet is annoying)

if you are here for my custom clearvision skin head over to the folder [bdskin](https://feedmes1eep.github.io/bdskin/)
