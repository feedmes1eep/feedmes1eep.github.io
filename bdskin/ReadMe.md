## CustomCVv6 is a modified theme (to my liking) of the theme ["ClearVision v6"](https://clearvision.gitlab.io/)
## ! Important ! I have stopped adding my own edits in here since the last 2nd commit. Mostly Becuase the clearvision team and contributors is back on it and has done a great job.

#### I keep the skin on the cloud so i can share it on different personal devices without copying the file/typing it down to 3+ devices everytime discord updates their styling.

Assuming you have BetterDiscord installed and know where to copy the file into. [Here ya go.](https://github.com/feedmes1eep/feedmes1eep.github.io/releases/download/v1.0/Custom_ClearVision.theme.css)

I will try to fix updated stylings, that gets broken by the updated normal discord stylings, as soon as possible. That is if the ClearVision team does not have it fixed.

If you want to use the Original ClearVision skin, [Here ya go.](https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v6/releases/download/6.0.0/ClearVision_v6.theme.css)
